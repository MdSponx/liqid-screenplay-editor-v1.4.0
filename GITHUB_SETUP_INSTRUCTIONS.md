## Steps to Create GitHub Repository

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

3. Description: "LiQid Screenplay Editor v1.4.0 with collaborative editing features"
4. Set to Public or Private (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Rename the default branch to main (optional, recommended)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Example Commands (replace with your actual GitHub username/repo)

# Example if your GitHub username is "yourusername" and repo is "liqid-screenplay-editor-v1.4.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/liqid-screenplay-editor-v1.4.0.git
git branch -M main
