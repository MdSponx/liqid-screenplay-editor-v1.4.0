# Persistence Issues Report - Screenplay Editor Implementation

**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Project:** LiQid Screenplay Editor  
**Environment:** Local Development (localhost:5175)

## Executive Summary

During testing of the screenplay editor implementation, several persistence-related issues were identified that affect the collaborative editing experience and data synchronization. This report documents the issues, their impact, and recommended solutions.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Y.js WebSocket Connection Failure (Critical)

**Issue:** Y.js WebSocket provider fails to establish connection with the server
**Status:** ❌ Not Working
**Impact:** High - Prevents real-time collaborative editing

**Details:**
- WebSocket server is running correctly on port 1234
- Basic WebSocket connections work (verified with simple test)
- Y.js WebSocket provider configuration issues prevent proper connection
- Error: "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established"

**Evidence:**
```
Console logs from http://localhost:5175/examples/yjs-demo:
- Y.js WebSocket connection closed
- WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:1234/demo-document' failed
- Connection attempts fail repeatedly
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Y.js WebSocket provider configuration mismatch
- Potential version compatibility issues between y-websocket and server setup
- Missing or incorrect WebSocket upgrade handling for Y.js protocol

### 2. Firebase Authentication Dependency (Medium)

**Issue:** Dashboard and main editor require authentication, blocking testing
**Status:** ⚠️ Blocking Access
**Impact:** Medium - Prevents testing of full editor features

**Details:**
- Dashboard stuck in loading state without authentication
- Main screenplay editor requires project/screenplay IDs from authenticated routes
- Firebase configuration present but creates barriers for testing

**Evidence:**
- Dashboard shows "dashboard.loading" indefinitely
- Protected routes redirect to authentication

### 3. Data Persistence Layer Inconsistencies (Medium)

**Issue:** Multiple persistence mechanisms without clear coordination
**Status:** ⚠️ Potential Conflicts
**Impact:** Medium - Risk of data loss or conflicts

**Details:**
- Firebase Firestore for user data and projects
- Y.js LevelDB persistence for collaborative documents
- Local state management for editor state
- No clear conflict resolution strategy

**Persistence Stack:**
```
1. Firebase Firestore (User data, projects, scenes)
2. Y.js LevelDB (Collaborative document state)
3. Local React state (UI state, active blocks)
4. Browser localStorage (Auth tokens, preferences)
```

### 4. WebSocket Server Configuration Issues (Low)

**Issue:** Y.js server setup may not be optimally configured for the client
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Review
**Impact:** Low - Server runs but client connection fails

**Details:**
- Server accepts basic WebSocket connections
- Y.js specific protocol handling may need adjustment
- CORS configuration appears correct
- Document persistence to LevelDB working

## Working Components

### ✅ Successfully Tested:

1. **Simple Screenplay Editor Demo**
   - URL: http://localhost:5175/examples/simple-screenplay
   - Full editing functionality
   - Proper screenplay formatting
   - Block type management
   - Real-time UI updates

2. **Scrollable Screenplay Example**
   - URL: http://localhost:5175/examples/scrollable-screenplay
   - Professional layout
   - Scene navigation
   - Page controls

3. **Basic WebSocket Server**
   - Port 1234 listening correctly
   - Accepts WebSocket upgrade requests
   - Basic message handling functional

## Impact Assessment

### High Priority Issues:
1. **Y.js Collaboration Failure** - Prevents multi-user editing
2. **Authentication Barriers** - Blocks access to full editor

### Medium Priority Issues:
1. **Data Persistence Coordination** - Risk of conflicts
2. **Firebase Configuration** - Emulator connection warnings

### Low Priority Issues:
1. **WebSocket Server Optimization** - Performance considerations
2. **Error Handling** - User experience improvements

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions (Critical):

1. **Fix Y.js WebSocket Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Update YjsEditor.tsx WebSocket provider configuration
   const wsProvider = new WebsocketProvider(
     websocketUrl,
     documentId,
     ydoc,
     {
       connect: true,
       params: {},
       WebSocketPolyfill: undefined,
       awareness: undefined,
       maxBackoffTime: 2500,
       disableBc: false,
       // Add Y.js specific options
       resyncInterval: 5000,
       maxBackoffTime: 2500
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Create Authentication Bypass for Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Add development-only routes that bypass authentication
   <Route path="/dev/editor" element={<ScreenplayEditor />} />
   <Route path="/dev/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
   ```

### Short-term Solutions (1-2 weeks):

1. **Implement Unified Persistence Strategy**
   - Define clear data ownership boundaries
   - Implement conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Add data synchronization monitoring

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add connection retry logic
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Add Persistence Health Monitoring**
   - Connection status indicators
   - Data sync status
   - Conflict detection alerts

### Long-term Solutions (1-2 months):

1. **Implement Offline-First Architecture**
   - Local-first data storage
   - Sync when connection available
   - Conflict resolution UI

2. **Add Data Migration Tools**
   - Version compatibility handling
   - Data format migration
   - Backup and restore functionality

## Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Testing:
1. Test Y.js server with different client configurations
2. Verify Firebase emulator setup
3. Test data persistence across browser sessions

### Comprehensive Testing:
1. Multi-user collaboration scenarios
2. Network interruption handling
3. Data conflict resolution
4. Performance under load

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. WebSocket connection success rate
2. Data synchronization latency
3. Conflict resolution frequency
4. User session persistence

### Monitoring Tools:
1. WebSocket connection logs
2. Firebase performance monitoring
3. Y.js document state tracking
4. Client-side error reporting

## Conclusion

While the core screenplay editing functionality is working well, the persistence layer requires attention to ensure reliable collaborative editing. The Y.js WebSocket connection issue is the highest priority, as it blocks the primary collaborative feature. The authentication dependency creates testing barriers that should be addressed with development-only routes.

The multiple persistence mechanisms need coordination to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity. With the recommended fixes, the screenplay editor should provide a robust, collaborative writing experience.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix Y.js WebSocket connection configuration
2. **Week 1:** Add authentication bypass for testing
3. **Week 2:** Implement persistence coordination strategy
4. **Week 3:** Add comprehensive error handling and monitoring
5. **Month 1:** Implement offline-first architecture
